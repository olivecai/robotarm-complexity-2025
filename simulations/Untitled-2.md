The online Jacobian update method works for 

step is weighted by three factors:
- if we are far away, decrease the step.
- if the jacobian is singular, decrease the step.

what if we try the online jacobian update for just the kinova?

i think all of this just suggests that we can converge with a surprisingly different jacobian.
