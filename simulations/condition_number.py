The condition number is a measure of sensitivity.
LARGE condition number: small perturbation leads to LARGE change in solution
SMALL: small perturbation correlates to a small change in solution.

Get condition number and compare to the radius of convergence.

Does there exist an equation to get the radius of convergence?

How can we get the radius of convergence...
