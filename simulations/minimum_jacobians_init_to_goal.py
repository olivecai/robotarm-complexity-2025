What if we consider the joint space and the cartesian space together, and this way we can also get a better sense of which basin of attraction we are in?
Ie, check if the cartesian position can successfully converge
And then check which of those success points, if our most influential joint can be moved towards one of our basins of attraction.

What do basins of attraction tell us?
That we need to CHOOSE a certain joint solution out of all the many solutions available: you cannot simply say that because the cartesian solution is there, that you are in the correct joint space to correspond with that cartesian solution.

- Choose a joint space solution for the final desired position that can eventually be accessed by the intiial position. It is very important that there exists a continuous line through the union of the BASINS OF ATTRACTION for all of our milestones.

# We could revisit the basins of attraction. Maybe later.
Start from the initial position. Store the joint position and the 3D end effector position.
Compute the inverse kinematics for all points in the joint space
