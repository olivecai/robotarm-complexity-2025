1. Specify CURRENT and specify GOAL
2. For GOAL, compute over the entire joint space the success/fail of convergence with a constant jacobian.
3. Get the closest point from that cloud of SUCCESS points to the GOAL POSITION
we store all the success/fail points for each point that converge to the GOAL POSITION --> then from the set of success points, we choose the closest point to the CURRENT GOAL POSITION and make that our intermediate step. REPEAT until we get to the GOAL.
