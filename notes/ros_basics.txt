ros basics

roscore: collection of nodes and programs - aka ros monster. contains info abt all nodes and ip addresses. knows who pub and sub to whom. can only have one roscore running at a time.
nodes: single exe file, performs some tasks: collects or sends data to nodes. two wasy to do this: service or topics.
topics: communicates bn ros nodes. rosnodes either sub or pub. one topic only one pub, inf subs. pub publishes information to topic, sub collects info. is a one way communication. a subscriber can be turned into publisher to send msgs back to initial publisher (ie publisher and sub switch roles)
messages: describe what content is pub to specific topic. message messages need to be described by their type

create a ros publisher, add catkin_intall_python(PROGRAMS scripts/publisher_node.py
	DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}) then save that file, then we run catkin_make in bash to build it.
	then we run source devel/setup.bash.
	
Then in a seperate terminal, we run roscore!!! which allows us to create nodes

Then go back the terminal where we ran catkin make and the source devel setup.bash, and run rosrun <package name> <publisher.py>

Now open a new terminal and type "rostopic list" 

then rostopic echo /<TOPIC YOU WANT TO SEE>

and it will start to echo at the Rate you set in the publisher!
